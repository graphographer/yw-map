## Youth Workforce Presence Map

The map is defined as a webcomponent which uses Leaflet internally.

To use it, include the `dist/YWMap.js`, e.g. `<script defer src="YWMap.js"></script>`.

This will register the custom element `yw-map`. You can then use it in your template, e.g. `<yw-map></yw-map>`.
